# Reasons Behind Crusader Kings’ Loyal Modders: An Analysis on Crusader Kings’ Modding Community

Nov 2022

## 1 Introduction

One of the most prominent aspects of Paradox games is its
player-created content and the sizable modding community
surrounding its games. The Crusader Kings series, for example, is especially favoured by modders. It has a modding discord server of 6000+ members with 1000+ online. It also has
5000+ steam workshop mods for a game released two years
ago.

Furthermore, Crusader Kings is one of the most modded
Paradox series. It hosts a majority of famous total conversion
mods, the Game of Thrones mod, the Princes of Darkness,
and Elder Kings(Brown, 2022). Modders even update these
mods across games, from Crusader Kings 2 to 3, utilising the
new engine and graphics.

There must be some underlying reason why modders are
encouraged to create content for Crusader Kings. After all, it
is time-consuming, and a good reason is needed to start. Discovering the reason can bring insight into building a loyal
modding community, whether modders mod more for personal or impersonal reasons. Thus, this paper seeks to discover the motivations of Crusader Kings’ modders and analyse the common traits that drew them to Crusader Kings
specifically.

**The formalised research questions:**

- What motivates Crusader Kings’ modders?
- Why are they willing to contribute to the Crusader Kings
modding community?
- Are there commonalities between their motivations?

The paper is structured as follows. Firstly, it overviews
the game, providing backgrounds and gameplay. Secondly, it
provides a detailed account on the methodology of the research. Thirdly, the results are presented, identifying the
underlying reasons that motivate Crusader Kings modders.
Fourthly, The results are discussed, reflecting upon the implications of the research. Finally, a summarisation is given
to show the answers found during our research.

## 2 Game Overview

### 2.1 Crusader Kings

Crusader Kings is a series of grand strategy games developed by Paradox, with currently three games in the series.
Its first title, Crusader Kings, was released in 2004, following Crusader Kings 2 in 2012, and now Crusader Kings 3 in
2020. Originally a small title, it gained popular success after
Crusader Kings 2, slowly forming a loyal player base expansion after expansion. The game can be considered the turning
point for Paradox Interactive, where the company went from
45 employees in 2012 to nearly 500 by 2019 (Hafer, 2019).

Crusader Kings can be played single-player and multiplayer, with multiplayer replacing the ruler AIs with actual
players. Therefore, it can involve a lot of role-playing elements. The player personates a medieval character through
the ages, with endless possibilities of what to become: a duke,
baroness, emperor, or even a loyal vassal. The game does
not enforce an objective on the player, and the player has the
choice to decide what to do. She can aim to expand her kingdom, duel her childhood friend, or even seduce the Pope. The
only thing fixed is the setting.

Crusader Kings is faithful to history in mechanics. While
it has inaccuracies here and there, such as Low mortality
rates(Cantalini, 2021), most of its mechanics are true to history—for instance, its detailed treatment of the feudal system.

The game’s uniqueness comes from the fact that it makes
history personalistic. Compared to Europa Universalis’ rational treatment of states, Crusader Kings is a battleground of
rulers with different personalities(Devereaux, 2022). It creates a space where organic stories can emerge. For example, when a lazy and charming son replaces a diligent, brave
father as ruler, significant changes will happen to the kingdom. The game’s charm comes from being entirely organically character-based. The player needs to court, balance her
vassals and pay attention to conspirators, Unlike most grand
strategies where rulers are abstract representations of states.

Crusader Kings’ review improves with its titles. Its first
game lacked a tutorial and had technical issues, as reflected
in its mediocre reviews. It had depth but discouraged casual
players because of its lack of approachability(Butts, 2004).
Crusader Kings 2, being the pillar of the franchise, took off
as one of the most loved grand strategy games. Being the
unique role-play Grand strategy on the market, it has a Metacritic score of 82(Crusader Kings II, n.d.). Crusader Kings
3, on the other hand, did even better, with a Metacritic score
of 91. Despite that, it has a lower user score(Crusader Kings
III, n.d.) and is less fleshed-out than its predecessor. However,
Crusader Kings 2 have had years of expansions and community content growth. That is still to come for Crusader Kings
3 (Hafer, 2020).

As a whole, Crusader Kings is genre-defining. It created
the character-based grand strategy genre and became one of
the best Paradox titles and grand strategy games. It is even
more famous for its countless player-created content and its
sizable modding community.

### 2.2 Crusader Kings’ Modding

Modding has evolved over the years for Crusader Kings. Crusader Kings 1 does not have mods available online, not on
Steam Workshop or Nexus mods. Some tools exist, such as
the DNA maker(Useful Tools, n.d.), where you can change
characters’ appearance, but that is about it. The modding for
the game only took off after Crusader Kings 2, after it slowly
gained following. It was an excellent platform for hosting
character-based fiction for its role-playing elements. Game
of throne mod was created for it, which benefited the game
greatly (Kaiser, 2016). Modders have many choices in modding. From minor mods that add icons and portraits to overhaul mods and total conversion mods that can completely ignore vanilla directories (Modding - Crusader Kings II Wiki,
n.d.).

Crusader Kings 3 expands on Crusader Kings 2’s modding
even more. The game is now powered by the brand new Jomini Engine, which expanded on ways the game could be
modded. It includes DirectX features, dynamic audio, and
better performance options. It also lowers the barrier to entry
for modders, as now modders can mod even without knowing
any scripting (Boudreau, 2018). One of the interviewees who
had worked in Paradox as a content developer for Crusader
Kings 3 also mentions that modders are given the same tools
to create in-game content as paradox employees.

The modding community currently revolves mainly around
steam workshops, with its discord server for easy collaboration between modders. It has 5000+ mods for Crusader Kings
3 in just two years. Other platforms that host mods also exist,
such as Mod Nexus and Paradox’s website, although with a
smaller mod base.

## 3 Methodology

The methodology of the paper is Qualitative analysis, using
grounded theory specifically. It creates codes from the interview data.

Qualitative analysis is selected instead of quantitative analysis because surveying many Crusader Kings’ modders in the
selected time frame is impossible. In addition, quantitative
analysis is more suitable for gathering value-based data. For
something ingrained such as personal motivations, in-depth
personal discussions are more suitable. At the same time,
surveying methods can lead to superficial answers.

### 3.1 Grounded theory

Grounded theory, a qualitative method, combines the strength
of quantitative and qualitative approaches. It is a method for
discovering common themes in the collected qualitative data.
It first breaks down the data into labels and then finds the similarities and differences through categorisation. It is an iterative process to reduce the data to its core themes or theories
(Walker & Myrick, 2006).

It first collects data related to the topic through forms such
as accessing public records, biography, news report, and faceto-face conversation. Both qualitative and quantitative data
can be collected for analysis (Brodin, Hellzen, & H ´ aggstr ¨ om, ¨
2017). This paper uses interviews as means of data collection
and focuses purely on qualitative data.

After that, the collected data are open-coded, where textual
data are labelled and broken up, forming codes(Flick, 2018).
Axial coding is then used to find the relationship between
these codes, forming categories. Memos are written throughout the process to document the details during the coding process.

After the core categories emerge, selective coding starts,
which connects the related categories around one central category. The core category then represents the central thesis
of the research. The open coding, axial coding and selective
coding process are also iterative and should be treated as a
non-linear process in order to consolidate the data (Williams
& Moser, 2019) continuously. Finally, the coding outcome is
developed into theory.

### 3.2 Demographic Selection

A subset of the modding community is selected from the
Crusader Kings modding collaboration discord. The discord
hosts players of varying skill levels, from brand new modders that only started days ago to very experienced ones that
had been doing it for years. Some even have direct ties with
Paradox and have worked on the game itself as content developers. The discord provides a good selection of modders that
ensures sample variety. A total of 10 participants were interviewed and selected based on their skill levels, from very experienced to completely inexperienced. Inexperienced modders provide fresh motivations, as their decision to start modding is recent. They can provide direct accounts. Experienced modders, on the other hand, have long-lasting motivations that keep them going and are likely to have worked on
big collaborative modding projects. They can provide more
detailed and personal accounts. Both kinds are valuable for
analysing the commonalities.

### 3.3 Interview Questions

The interviews are in free-flow form, as the research is exploratory. The questions are open-ended and focus on discovering their motivation. As the participants’ skill levels
vary, the questions are also modified accordingly. Depending on their initial answers, follow-up questions were added
as further exploration. Their ages were also queried to gain a
perspective on the demography of Crusader Kings’ modding
community.

**The general questions are listed below:**
- How experienced are you with modding?
- When did you start modding?
- When did you start modding for Crusader Kings?
- How long have you been modding? What drove you to
continue?
- What motivates you to mod?

### 3.4 Privacy

Because of the subjectivity of the answers of interviewees,
the results can be identifying. Therefore, subjects interviewed
during the research will remain unnamed to protect their privacy.

### 4.3 Selective Coding

Axial coding was applied again along with this process as
more general patterns emerged. For instance, Low Barrier to
Entry, Modding Support and Existing Expertise are all related
to the difficulty of the modding process and can be merged
into a single category.

After the final secondary categories had emerged, as shown
in figure 1, it was clear that vision realization is the main
theme for mod creation. The category community distinguish
whether the vision is collective or singular and demonstrates
community support. Technical Ease serves to make modding
more accessible and give modders more freedom. Game Optimization and Creativity are two different but not mutually
exclusive vision goals in themselves. Self-actualization is a
result of achieving their visions. All categories either are the
vision or help with achieving the vision.

## 5 Discussion

### 5.1 Process reflection

Figure 1: The Selective Coding where the core category ”Realization of Vision” emerges; Realizing vision itself is always the goal,
regardless of collaboratively or individually. Modding support or a
Low barrier to entry merely supports that goal.

Because the paper used free-flow interviews to collect data,
the amount of data generated per interviewee varies. This method can make the codes generated lean towards some of
the more talkative interviewees. Some were very willing to
share, even providing their previous interviews as references.
In contrast, some others were less willing to talk. This bias
could be mitigated if there were a larger selection of interviewees. However, that leads to the next concern, the number of
codes.

The number of codes the analysis stage included can cause
omission. Too many codes could be extracted from the data
as motivation, as ten people were interviewed. This sample is
still quite large for qualitative analysis. The significant number of codes increased the difficulty of axial coding, and the
more codes there are, the more different ways the data could
be interpreted. There exist code relations that this paper was
not able to find. One way to mitigate this is to have multiple people perform the same process, which could not be
performed in this paper because of time constraints.

Also, axial coding was performed twice instead of doing
the entire process multiple times. Partly because the number
of categories available made it too difficult to find the core
category and partly because there are clear relations between
specific categories. It was an excellent decision to perform
axial coding again, as it made selective coding much more
straightforward.

### 5.2 Result reflection

The resulting core category was Realization of Vision. The
final secondary categories were all surrounded by the same
theme. For Community, it is usually some shared vision
that needs to be expressed. For Game Optimization, SelfActualization and Creativity, they are different visions, with
different goals needing to be realized. For Technical Ease,
they are an assortment of tools that helps with vision realization. Therefore it can be concluded that modders mod
because they wish to enforce or see their vision achieved,
whether individual or collaborative. They are more likely to
continue if there is support from the community, and easy access to tools and help.

The issue with the final theory is that it can be obvious.
Also, it gives little guidance on how to build a loyal modding
community. Modding itself can reflect that you want to create
something, which already means you want to realize a particular vision. Therefore, this paper’s open and axial codes are
more valuable for community building purposes, for finding
ways to draw people to mod. They give more detailed information on why people mod.

The Technical Ease category, for instance, gives concrete
steps on what the company could do if encouraging modding
is the goal. It can be done by making game content code
available, expanding modding tools, making more aspects of
the game moddable, have good documentation.

### 5.3 Related Research

Research on modding communities exists but is rare. We
were able to find one done on another game title, Skyrim. It
follows a similar research process to this paper, using ground
theory. The difference is that they used surveys as means of
data collection. They concluded that modders are motivated
by several motivations instead of just one or two, and interconnectivity exist between them. They found their motivations are correcting game flaws, artistic expression, personal
advancement and enjoyment(Hackman & Bjorkqvist, 2014).

## 6 Conclusion

This paper set out to find why modders are encouraged to mod
for Crusader Kings, what drew them towards modding for the
game. Specifically, the commonalities between their motivations. We were able to find the answers to these questions,
with both a general motivation and more diverse motivations
specific to the individual.

We found that modders mod for Crusader Kings because
they wish to realize their vision. It can be a collective vision
or a singular vision. Their goals are primarily divided into
either creative purposes or optimizing the game as forms of
self-actualization. Their motivations are further increased by
the community help surrounding it and the technical ease of
creating mods.
