  I wholeheartedly endorse Haocheng Yang. He has excellent problem-solving skills which he employed on our research project where he was working with emerging games technology that had little documentation.  He was creative in his approach to research bringing fresh insights to the team. What truly stands out is Haochengâ€™s ability to excel independently, a trait that showcases his dedication and self-motivation. Beyond his impressive technical skills, Haocheng is incredibly helpful and personable, making collaboration a joy.
