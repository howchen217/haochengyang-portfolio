# A for Aletta

January 2021 - December 2021

A for Aletta is an adventure visual novel with a pixel art style developed in Unity C#. It was a personal project I undertook during my bachelor's. Being an indie project, I programmed, wrote the screenplay, and created all the artwork for the entire game. It received surprisingly favourable responses on the Play Store, boasting a score of 4.6, 10k downloads, and 70+ reviews.

The game features a simple click-to-advance mechanic with minimalistic controls, marking my initial step towards pursuing game development as a career. It honed my time management skills and provided a comprehensive understanding of all aspects of game development due to its indie nature. Inspired by figures like Toby Fox, I also aspired to create my own indie game.

The most important lesson I learned was the variety of knowledge and the amount of self-motivation needed for such an indie project. It requires incredible energy to create, yet leads to an unknown result. I knew that a game of this scale without a publisher would likely be swallowed by the sea of the app store and soon forgotten. However, to my surprise, it received very positive responses, and players had very kind words to say about this tiny indie title. It gave me the courage to continue towards the game industry despite its difficulties and depth.
