# Scouts Odyssey
Scouts' Odyssey is a narrative puzzle adventure I developed for The Chinese Room as my final master's project. Our team consisted of ten members: one producer, two programmers (myself and another focusing on technical art), three designers, three artists, and an audio expert. We worked for about four months, from May 2023 to September, to create a complete puzzle level.

In the game, you play as a young scout living out your scout leader's campfire story in your imagination. Because it's all in your head, you can change the environment around you, which helps you solve the challenges presented. The game mixes traditional puzzle elements (like collecting items and using them in the environment) with a cool twist â€“ you can change the environment itself while you play.

I was responsible for most gameplay systems, while the other programmer focused on technical art. Overall, I implemented the dialogue system, inventory system, scene performance, and AI for animated characters. I also made tools to make debugging easier. In the upcoming sections, I'll explain the problems I faced and how I tackled them.
