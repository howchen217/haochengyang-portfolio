A multiplayer versus game. The Cop must defend the mall with various gadgets to prevent the thief from getting their loot. 

I implemented most of its game systems and some of the multiplayer aspect. 

I implemented:
All game mechanics
Most pickupable items
Player movement
Inventory
Player Attributes
Loading and Saving
Network sync
