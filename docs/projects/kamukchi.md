An adventure game that has 3d melee against enemies based on behavior trees.

I was the sole coder of the project. Being a game jam project, the entire game was implemented in a week. 

I implemented:
Melee combo system
BehaviorTree-based enemies
BehaviorTree-based NPC
Reusable SFX & Music System
Destructible objects
