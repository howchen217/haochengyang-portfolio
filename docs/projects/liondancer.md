# Lion Dancer

Lion Dancer is a boss-rush arena fighter created as a startup project for Transfuzer 2023. I was one of the programmers from Team Carnivore. We were a group of two designers, one artist and three programmers. 

My responsibility was Boss creation, fitting and fine-tuning boss moves and animations, and modifying decision trees. I joined the project halfway; at the time, most of the yearling boss moves were out of sync, the attack timings were either too early or delayed, and the boss moved somewhat mechanically. I was able to navigate existing code bases, create a messaging system that triggers attacks at exact times, and break down boss attacks to make them easily adjustable. I also integrated transitional animations to make the boss's movement more lively. Below are more specific breakdowns of how I implemented the boss's actions.
