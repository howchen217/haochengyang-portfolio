# Therapet

A AR game where you interact with an augmented reality dog, play fetch with it, feed it food, and ask it to follow you or sit down. 

I am the programmer responsible for the dogâ€™s AI and behavior. 

I implemented:
Interactable dog that reacts to real-life environment
Dog AI behavior such as Fetching, Feeding, Sit, Stand
Procedural animation for the dog
Ragdoll interaction where player can pet and move dog's head
Game Download: requires Hololens 2
